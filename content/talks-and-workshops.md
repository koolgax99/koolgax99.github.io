Hello Everyone, these are few of the many talks I have given at various events.

## Basic Computers for students at a Local School

![Local School Workshop](/img/local-school-workshop.jpeg)

In this program conducted @ a local school near IIIT Dharwad in collaboration with IEEE Student Branch, IIIT Dharwad, I taught local students who had never seen a computer about computers. Doing something for the community felt really good and I am very proud of it. Without a doubt I would love to see those kids again so that I can teach them again about things that they don't have access to.

In this workshop conducted @ Deshpande Startups in collaboration with GDG Hubli for Google I/O extended,
got a chance to showcase and explain my 'Importance of EDA Project'.It was an exciting workshop as it was the first one that I was conducting outside my college. It was a great experience to present in front of a crowd of more than 100.
