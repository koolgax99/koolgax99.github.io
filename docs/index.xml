      <description>Project Summary Organization: PEcAn Project
Mentors: Rob Kooper(@robkooper), Istem Fer(@istfer)
Student: Nihar Sanda(https://koolgax99.github.io)(@koolgax99)
My Proposal The project aims at improving and extending the current PEcAn REST API&amp;rsquo;s by making it more robust and dynamic from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective. The security of the API&amp;rsquo;s will also be improved by introducing API KEY management system, rate limitng and input validation.
Pre-GSoC Period This period was mainly focused on understanding the codebase of the PEcAn Project and the current state of the API&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>What is #66daysofdata? #66DaysOfData was started by a famous youtuber named Ken Jee. For 66 days, everyday you have to learn something related to Data Science for a minimum of 5 minutes (5 minutes since one cannot be free for a long time everyday) and then share it on social media. This idea was taken up by the Data Science and Artifical Intelligence (DSAI) Society of IIIT Dharwad to start this initiative for the students of IIIT Dharwad.</description>

      <description>Welcome everyone, in this article we will be implementing the Flutter push notifications using the AWS Simple Notification Services (SNS). We will be using Firebase Cloud Messaging as the Service Provider for the Messaging.
Creating a Flutter Project: Firstly we will create a new project and I will name it flutter_aws_notification.
You can give any name to your package. Ensure that you remember it because we will need it while registering our app on Google Firebase.</description>
